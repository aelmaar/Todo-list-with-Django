# Todo-list-with-Django
Building Todo list app with user authentication in Django \
\
At this project, I focused more on the backend than the front end :smiley:, also I don't used built in forms provided by Django since I want to build things from scratch, and It was a funny project :relaxed: \
I found difficulty to host my app on Heroku but its worth doing [APP](https://djangotodolist2022.herokuapp.com).
## Setup
1- make sure you have django version 4 installed. \
2- Run migrate command to create database file with actual model fields
```
python manage.py migrate
```
3- Run the app :relaxed:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
